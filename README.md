ATMEGA48PLIBRARIES
==================
This repository is to provide routine libraries
for the ATMEGA48P with the intent of providing
assistance to students in Spring-2013-EE234.
Use other than this, is of course greatly encouraged,
However the one restriction I would like to place
is if you are a fellow student in this class please
do not lift this code and attribute it to yourself.
I will go to the Professor about plagerism should I
discover any. So feel free to use and cite this 
library. I will likely be updating them periodically.
If you have questions, concerns or would like to 
contribute please contact my either in class or at
zactyy@gmail.com
